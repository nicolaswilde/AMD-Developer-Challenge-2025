## About AMD Developer Challenge 2025

https://www.datamonsters.com/amd-developer-challenge-2025

The challenge is a competition to develop high-performance kernels for AMD MI300X GPUs, including FP8 GEMM, MoE, and MLA Decode.

## About This Repository

This repository contains the submissions for the AMD Developer Challenge 2025.

The final submissions:

- [amd-fp8-mm-submission.py](./1-amd-fp8-mm/amd-fp8-mm-submission.py)
- [amd-moe-submission.py](./2-amd-moe/amd-moe-submission.py)
- [amd-mla-submission.py](./3-amd-mla-decode/amd-mla-submission.py)

**Note**: Other .py files are experimental/optimization attempts.

## Execution Guide

### Online Submission

Submit via GPU Mode Discord: https://discord.com/channels/1189498204333543425/1343002583001726986. Using:

- `/leaderboard submit test`
- `/leaderboard submit benchmark`
-  `/leaderboard submit ranked`

### Local Execution

**Prerequisites**:

- AMD MI300X GPU
- ROCm and PyTorch installed

**Steps**:

1. Clone the **reference repository**, which is the official code repository for the AMD Developer Challenge 2025:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gpu-mode/reference-kernels.git
   ```

2. Replace submission files in the cloned repository with the ones from this repository. **Taking `amd-fp8-mm` as an example**:
   - replace the content of `/reference-kernels/problems/amd/fp8-mm/submission.py` with the content of my `1-amd-fp8-mm/amd-fp8-mm-submission.py`

3. Create the tests file and add benchmarks.
    - create `/reference-kernels/problems/amd/fp8-mm/tests` file and add the benchmarks according to `/reference-kernels/problems/amd/fp8-mm/task.yml`:
        ``` yaml
        m: 1024; n: 1536; k: 7168; seed: 8135
        m: 1024; n: 3072; k: 1536; seed: 6251
        m: 1024; n: 576 ; k: 7168; seed: 12346
        m: 1024; n: 7168; k: 256 ; seed: 5364
        m: 1024; n: 7168; k: 2048; seed: 6132
        m: 1024; n: 4608; k: 7168; seed: 7531
        m: 1024; n: 7168; k: 2304; seed: 12345
        m: 1024; n: 512 ; k: 7168; seed: 6563
        m: 1024; n: 4096; k: 512 ; seed: 17512
        m: 6144; n: 1536; k: 7168; seed: 6543
        m: 6144; n: 3072; k: 1536; seed: 234
        m: 6144; n: 576 ; k: 7168; seed: 9863
        m: 6144; n: 7168; k: 256 ; seed: 764243
        m: 6144; n: 7168; k: 2048; seed: 76547
        m: 6144; n: 4608; k: 7168; seed: 65436
        m: 6144; n: 7168; k: 2304; seed: 452345
        m: 6144; n: 512 ; k: 7168; seed: 12341
        m: 6144; n: 4096; k: 512 ; seed: 45245
        ```

4. Modify the evaluation script to include the custom kernel.
    - add the following lines to `/reference-kernels/problems/amd/eval.py` (be careful that the mla-decode kernel has its own eval.py: `/reference-kernels/problems/amd/mla-decode/eval.py`):
        ```python
        import sys, os
        if sys.stdout is None:
            sys.stdout = open(os.devnull, 'w')
        if sys.stderr is None:
            sys.stderr = open(os.devnull, 'w')

        sys.path.append("./fp8-mm")
        from submission import custom_kernel
        ```

5. Run evaluation.
    ```bash
    POPCORN_FD=1 python eval.py benchmark ./fp8-mm/tests
    ```
